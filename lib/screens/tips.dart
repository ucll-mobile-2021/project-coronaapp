You use a face mask to cover your nose and mouth. When you sneeze, cough or talk, droplets fly around. The face mask blocks the droplets. That way, there is less risk of making someone sick. In other words, wearing a face mask is primarily about protecting others.",

Maybe you blew your nose in a tissue and then went outside to dig around the dirt. Whatever you did today, you came into contact with germs. It's easy for a germ on your hand to end up in your mouth. Think about how many foods you eat with your hands. You can't wear rubber gloves all day long, but you can wash your hands so those germs don't get a chance to make you or someone else sick.",
